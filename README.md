# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each problem has its own file, and the solution is implemented in Python. Below is a list of the problems solved, along with a brief description of each one.

## Problem 1: Find Maximum Consecutive Ones

- **File**: `find_max_consecutive_ones.py`
- **Problem**: Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`s in the array.
  
### Example:
```text
Input: nums = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits and the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
```

## Problem 2: Count Numbers with Even Number of Digits

- **File**: `count_even_digits.py`
- **Problem**: Given an array of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.

### Example:
```text
Input: nums = [12, 345, 2, 6, 7896]
Output: 2
Explanation: 12 contains 2 digits (even number of digits), and 7896 contains 4 digits.
```

## Problem 3: Squares of a Sorted Array

- **File**: `sorted_squares.py`
- **Problem**: Given an array of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Example:
```text
Input: nums = [-4, -1, 0, 3, 10]
Output: [0, 1, 9, 16, 100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16, 1, 0, 9, 100]. After sorting, it becomes [0, 1, 9, 16, 100].
```
